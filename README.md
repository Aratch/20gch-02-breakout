# Breakout (20 Games Challenge)

A quick and dirty Breakout implementation for the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/) made in Godot 4.4.1.

Implements:
- Paddle and ball
- Destructible bricks
- Lives and score counters
- The ball can be launched upwards when in the initial state (after a life is lost or at the beginning of the game)
